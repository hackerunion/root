# What is Hacker Union?

We are an:

 - Independent
 - Non-profit
 - Inclusive
 - Transparent
 - Light-hearted

... organization of hackers, builders, designers, and others who use technology creatively.

## Who is Welcome?

**Everyone!** As long as you're looking to contribute -- not to take advantage.

You don't need to use a particular OS or work at a startup or write everything in C to join. We're a group of experienced, novice, and soon-to-be hackers. We encourage mentorship, collaboration, and learning.

*Our goal is to provide the connection, friendship, guidance, and resources to make being a technologist even more awesome.*
