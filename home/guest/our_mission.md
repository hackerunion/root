# What is Hacker Union?

*Our goal is to help you plug into the tech community.*

More specifically, we are an:

 - Awesome
 - Non-profit
 - Inclusive
 - Community organized
 - Kinda silly

... organization of "hackers" who write code and build stuff -- for fun, for profit, or both.

## Who is Welcome?

**Everyone!** You don't need to use a particular OS or work at a startup or write everything in C to join Hacker Union.

We're a group of experienced, novice, and soon-to-be hackers. We encourage mentorship, collaboration, and learning.

Don't believe us? [Come to an event][1].
