*Our goal is to help you plug into the tech community.*

## Our Members

We're a group of technologists who like building stuff and think that community is important.

Through Hacker Union, we support one another, teach one another, and work with one another. Why? Mostly for fun.

## Our Events

We keep things simple:

 - We host a weekly hack night
 - We host a monthly town hall
 - We provide resources to the tech community
 - [Come to an event][1]

## Our Structure
  
 - Anyone can join
 - Anyone can lead
 - We have local chapters
 - [Start a chapter][2]

## Getting Involved

Want to participate? Stop by one of our hack nights and introduce yourself. If you want access to our resources (servers, space, funding, data), you need only [let us know][3].

You'll get a username, a member ID, and a contact. And no recruiting, please.
