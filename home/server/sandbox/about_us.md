# What is Hacker Union?

*There's no shortage of groups supporting specific tools, projects, or industries. Our goal is to bring these communities together into a cohesive whole.*

## Our People

We're a diverse group of technologists who like building stuff and think that community is important.

Through Hacker Union, we support one another, teach one another, and build professional relationships to help us grow as builders.

## Our Events

We keep things simple:

 - We host a weekly hack night
 - We host a monthly town hall
 - We provide resources to help strengthen the community
 - [Do a hack night](/)

## Our Structure
  
 - Anyone can join
 - Anyone can lead
 - Leaders help organize and keep things running
 - Regions are associated with chapters
 - [Start a chapter](/)

## Getting Involved

To participate, you need only show up to one of our hack nights-- offline *or* online. If you want access to our resources (servers, space, funding, directory), you need only let an organizer know.

You'll get a username, a member ID, and an advisor. If you're a recruiter, service provider, or another sort trying to exploit the group, you'll be asked (politely) to leave.

## Next Steps
