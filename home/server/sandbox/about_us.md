# What is Hacker Union?

*There are tons of great resources and groups in the tech community. Our goal is to organize these into a cohesive whole.*

----

## Our People

We're a diverse group of technologists who like building stuff and think that community is important.

Through Hacker Union, we support one another, teach one another, and work with one another. Why? Mostly for fun.

## Our Events

We keep things simple:

 - We host a weekly hack night
 - We host a monthly town hall
 - We provide resources to help strengthen the community
 - [Come to an event][1]

## Our Structure
  
 - Anyone can join
 - Anyone can lead
 - Regions are organized into chapters
 - [Start a chapter][2]

## Getting Involved

Want to participate? Stop by one of our hack nights-- online *or* offline-- and introduce yourself. If you want access to our resources (servers, space, funding, data), you need only let an organizer know.

You'll get a username, a member ID, and an advisor. And no recruiting, please.
