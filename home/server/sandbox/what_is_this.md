## Who is Welcome?

**Everyone!** As long as you're looking to contribute -- not to take advantage.

aYou don't need to use a particular OS or work at a startup or write everything in C to join. We're a group of experienced, novice, and soon-to-be hackers. We encourage mentorship, collaboration, and learning.

*Our goal is to provide the connection, friendship, and guidance that will help you be a part of the broader technology community.*

We're a community for hackers, by hackers.
